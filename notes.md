- Q = Quantity
- P = Price
- Marginal Cost MC = $\Delta \frac{TC(Q)}{Q}$
- Marginal Revenue MR = $\Delta \frac{TR(Q)}{Q}$
- Average Total Cost $ATC(Q) = \frac{TC(Q)}{Q}$
- Profit $\Pi (Q) = TR(Q) - TC(Q)$
- Profit Maximization Point Q*: MC = MR
  - Cost of producing an additional unit of output (MC) equals the revenue that
    would be received from that additional unit of output (MR)

### Example Questions

Given maximized profit at Q*, what are TFC(Q*), TVC(Q*)?

- $TC(Q) = \frac{125Q^3}{3} + 1000$, Price is $2000 per Q
- So $TVC = 125Q^3/3$, $TFC = 1000$
- $\Pi (Q) = TR(Q) - TC(Q) = 2000 \cdot Q - 125Q^3 - 1000$
- Maximize profit: $\frac{\delta \Pi (Q)}{\delta (Q)} = 0 = 2000 - 125Q^2
  \implies Q^2 = 16 \implies Q = 4 = Q^*$
